# Police Dashboard
This application was made for Purdue's hackathon, boilermake, using over 1.6 million data points from real chicago police data. The program constructs a webpage that displays a timeline for a selected precinct. On the timeline you can see, by unit, all of their activity over the three months of data given. The program also parses the data and outputs analytics like most/ least productive police precienct or unit and average time to resolve events.

and "deactivate" when you are done
